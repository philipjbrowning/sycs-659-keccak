  * in Section 7.2 of [Bertoni et al., Sufficient conditions for sound tree 
  * and sequential hashing modes, IACR ePrint 2009/210], 
  * where the tree has fixed height <i>H</i>=2, 
  * the final node has (parameterized) degree <i>D</i>,
  * and the message bits are interleaved by blocks of (parameterized) 
  * <i>B</i> bits onto the <i>D</i> leaves.
  * When the leaves are done absorbing the message blocks, a bit 0 is appended
  * for domain separation with the final node.
  * The chaining value size <i>C</i> is equal to the capacity of the
  * underlying sponge function, rounded up to the next multiple of 8 bits.
  * The final node contains:
  * - the concatenation of the <i>D</i> chaining values each of size <i>C</i>;
  * - the value <i>B</i> coded on 32-bit in a little-endian fashion;
  * - 5 bits set to zero (reserved for future use, for other layouts);
  * - the final bit set to 1 for domain separation with leaves.
